I am a Staff Research Scientist at Siemens. As a researcher I work on a gamut of problems that fall at the intersection of Knowledge graph representation and construction, optimization, vision and language. My day to day work encompasses three fields of AI :

* **Language** : NLP, deep learning for information extraction, large scale question answering.
* **Vision & Language** : Visual question answering, Visual query reformulation.
* **Knowledge Graphs** : Multi modal knowledge graph construction, representation and optimization.

Prior to Siemens I got my PhD at RPI, where I worked with [Jim Hendler](https://www.cs.rpi.edu/~hendler/) and [Deborah McGuinness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deborah_McGuinness) on knowledge graphs, query reformulation, entity summarization, knowledge graph construction, Ontology development, Ontology alignment. I also had a chance to work on the IBM Watson question answering framework at RPI.

I had two fruitful internships at IBM TJ Watson research center and worked on summarization and query reformulation.

Before RPI I also worked as a senior software engineer in text analytics at Infosys Technologies limited where I focused on Natural Language processing, specifically pattern oriented NLP.
